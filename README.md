Unified-Validator: Streamline Your Validation Process

Unified-Validator is a powerful TypeScript/JavaScript library that bridges the gap between class-validator and Swagger documentation. It provides a set of decorators that simultaneously validate your data using class-validator and generate corresponding Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

Key Features:
- Single decorator for both validation and API documentation
- Seamless integration with class-validator and Swagger/OpenAPI
- Type-safe and easy to use with TypeScript
- Reduces code duplication and improves maintainability
- Customizable validation rules and Swagger properties
- Supports nested objects and complex data structures

Whether you're building a REST API or a full-stack application, Unified-Validator simplifies your development process by unifying data validation and API documentation in one step. Say goodbye to inconsistencies between your validation logic and API specs, and hello to a more efficient, error-free development experience.
